# 🌍 World Happiness Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the **2018** and **2019** World Happiness datasets to explore the factors influencing happiness scores across countries and to identify differences between the two years.

**Dependent variable:**
- Happiness Score

**Independent variables:**
- 💰 GDP per capita  
- 🤝 Social support  
- 🏥 Healthy life expectancy  
- 🗽 Freedom to make life choices  
- 💝 Generosity  
- ⚖️ Perceptions of corruption  

---

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Compare the internal structure of datasets from 2018 and 2019.
- Identify meaningful changes and trends between the two years.
- Build a **modular analytical framework** to run multiple regression models.
- Conduct regression assumption testing and coefficient comparisons.
- Visualize and clearly communicate insights through charts.

## 🧮 Methodology
**Models tested:**
- Ordinary Least Squares (**OLS**)
- Robust OLS
- Log OLS
- Weighted Least Squares (**WLS**)

**Evaluation criteria:**
- 📐 Akaike Information Criterion (**AIC**)  
- 📏 Bayesian Information Criterion (**BIC**)  
- 📊 R-squared (**R²**)  
- 🔗 Correlation with the dependent variable  

**Outcome:**
- **2018:** OLS model performed best overall.  
- **2019:** Robust OLS model achieved the best fit.  

In addition to predictions, the project involved **detailed statistical analysis** — including model diagnostics, regression assumption testing, and coefficient comparisons — to gain deeper insights.
