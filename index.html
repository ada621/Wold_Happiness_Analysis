        </h2>
        <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.6; color: #555;">
            In this project, I worked with the <strong>2018</strong> and <strong>2019</strong> World Happiness datasets. 
            My aim was to analyze the internal structure of each year's data and explore the differences and changes between them over time.
            ➕In addition to obtaining prediction results, I sought to perform a comprehensive statistical analysis that included evaluating
            the model, testing regression assumptions, and comparing coefficients to gain deeper insights into the data.

        <h2>📊Effect of Variables by Year</h2>
        <p>This graph shows the change in factors affecting happiness scores over the years..</p>
        <img src="figures/degisken_etkileri_yillar.png" alt="Değişken Etkileri Yıllar">
        <p>📢Looking at the variable effects chart, we see that in 2019 the effects of social support, freedom to make life choices, healthy life 
        expectancy, and perception of corruption increased, while the effects of GDP per capita and generosity decreased.These changes are
        generally around ±0.2. However,since the effects of perception of corruption and generosity are quite weak, we can mostly talk about
        their indirect influence rather than a direct one.</p>

        <p>From these results, it can be said that freedom to make life choices has a very important and key role in happiness scores. At the same 
        time, social support—reflecting interpersonal relationships—and factors with roughly the same level of influence, such as income
        distribution (GDPper capita) and healthy life expectancy, are among the most influential and should be considered carefully.</p>

        <p>Both generosity and social support relate to social relationships, but the weak effect of generosity can be explained in a few ways:
        Generosity mainly refers to helping others, while social support is more about receiving help—support that people get during difficult
        times or when in need.</p>

        <p>Another important difference is that generosity is often limited to our close social circle, whereas social support can come both 
        from personal networks like family and friends and from more structured sources such as institutions or organizations.Therefore, the 
        scope of support and impact on individuals can differ significantly.</p>

        <h2>😊Happiness Label Distribution</h2>
        <p>The distribution of happiness scores by labels is shown in the graph below..</p>
        <img src="figures/mutluluk_etiket_dagilimi.png" alt="Mutluluk Etiket Dağılımı">
        <p>📢In the happiness label distribution bar chart, the "above average" label increased in 2019 compared to 2018. The "average" and "low"
        labels slightly decreased in 2019, while the "very low" label showed a small increase. For the "high" label, we don't see any change.</p>

        <p>From this, we can say that in 2019 the labels shifted more toward the extremes. As the "average" label decreased, the "above average"
        and "very low" labels increased. However, the fact that the "high" label didn't change suggests that this shift wasn't very strong.
        There could be a few reasons for this shift--->
        We previously found that GDP per capita had a stronger positive effect on the happiness score in 2018.The decrease in GDP per capita's
        effect might have influenced the label changes.
        Another factor affecting the label changes could be the combination of independent variables.
        for example:
        The "freedom to make life choices" variable is the most influential variable.However,when we compare the United Kingdom's 2018 and 
        2019 data, we see that the freedom to make life choice variable decreased in 2019, while GDP per capita, social support, and healthy 
        life expectancy scores increased. This could explain the difference in 2018 labels and why the 2019 label didn't change.
        Perhaps the increase in freedom to make a life choice balance out the decreases in the other variables.</p>

        <h2>⚖️ Model Selection & Machine Learning Comparison</h2>
        
        <p><strong>2018:</strong> OLS model was selected because no heteroskedasticity was detected 
        and the model fit the data well. It provided strong interpretability and simplicity.</p>
        
        <p><strong>2019:</strong> Significant heteroskedasticity was present. After evaluating OLS, Robust OLS, WLS, and Log OLS:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Robust OLS reduced but did not eliminate heteroskedasticity; still less sensitive to outliers than OLS.</li>
            <li>WLS achieved very high R² but was likely overfitted due to outlier influence.</li>
            <li>Log OLS had low AIC/BIC but made interpretation more complex.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Based on this, <strong>Robust OLS</strong> was chosen for 2019.</p>
        
        <h3>📈 Additional ML Model Evaluation</h3>
        <p>To complement statistical models, <strong>Gradient Boosting Regressor</strong> was tested for both years.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>2018:</strong>Gradient Boosting R² ≈ 0.607, lower than OLS (0.692), with slightly higher errors → data likely linear.</li>
            <li><strong>2019:</strong>Gradient Boosting R² ≈ 0.579, slightly below Robust OLS (0.602) → small difference, but no gain without tuning.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Classical regression models outperformed boosting in both years. 
        ML models still served as robustness checks and confirmed the dominance of linear relationships 
        in the World Happiness data.</p>
        
        <h3>🏆 Final Selection</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2018 → <strong>OLS</strong></li>
            <li>2019 → <strong>Robust OLS</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Comparison of model-predicted happiness scores with actual scores for 2018.</p>
        <img src="figures/tahmin_vs_gercek_2018.png" alt="Tahmin vs Gerçek 2018">
        <p>📢In the 2018 dataset, the OLS model produced predictions very close to the actual values for most countries, with the majority 
        of points lying near the 45° reference line—indicating a strong overall fit. However, there is a slight underestimation tendency
        for high happiness scores and some overestimation for lower scores, suggesting that the model's performance at extreme values is slightly
        weaker compared to mid-range values.</p>
